/*
Input: K (amount of clusters), set of points x1 ... xn (individuals in our data set)
Place K centroids in random locations c1 .... ck

Repeat until convergence: 

	- for each point xi, find the nearest centroid to that individual.
		compute the distance between xi and cj and pick the nearest centroid. assign the point to the cluster
	
	- run over your clusters, and for each centroid, recompute its position. 
		take all the data points that were assigned to that cluster, take their vectors and average them out
		add them up, devide them by the total of number of elements assigned to the cluster

	- stop when none of the clusters assignments change
